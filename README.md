# react-universal-app-generator

`react-universal-app-generator` is a project heavily inspired by [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (CRA). Unlike CRA which is gradually turning into a beast, focus of this project is on simplicity. The goal is to provide easy setup to start dealing with real problems, instead focusing on a lot of problems related to proper build configuration for universal applications. Once you get to the phase where have something real implemented, you can just eject configs and fine tune everything appropriately.
